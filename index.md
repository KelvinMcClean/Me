## Profile
I'm a Software Engineer based in Belfast. 
I've worked primarily in Java, but have strong skills and enterprise experience with Python, SQL, MongoDB, Docker, Bash/PowerShell, and the Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
I'm looking for a company that has an interest in supporting open-source software.

## Experience

### Software Engineer | iManage
#### Belfast | Aug 2019 - Present

I took a graduate role at iManage as a software engineer. 
I worked on various projects there, mainly focused on Java and SQL work.
As I progressed, I came to take leadership of the CI/CD and testing infrastructure for the office.
I've found I have skills in looking into unfamiliar codebases, analysing issues, and solving problems.
I love getting systems interconnected and working together, and have come to enjoy the role.

### Intern Software Engineer | Liberty Mutual
#### Boston | Sept 2016 - Aug 2017

I worked on the predictive modelling team. 
I built models to aid in calculating losses in accidents. I led the car total loss model, which predicted for the company when it was in their interests to replace a car that had been in an accident, based on legacy quotes from previous suppliers.
Primarily using Java, some work in React.

## Education

### 1st Year PhD
#### QUB | Sept 2018 - Aug 2019
I completed the first year of a PhD at Queen's University Belfast.
My project was based on analysing FOSS to determine the `quality` of the project, and the impact of those who are working on it.
I left my studies for personal reasons, but passed differentiation, and succeeded in getting a paper published - which can be found [here](docs/A_Review_into_Social_Network_Analysis_of_Open_Source_Software_Networks.pdf).

### MEng Games Development
#### QUB | 1st Class Honours | Sept 2013 - July 2018
My [Dissertation](docs/Dissertation.pdf) was based on the Reverse Generation of Games, so that puzzles could be generated on the fly. I thrived working with OpenGL and C++ in this course, and built a strong programming foundation.

## Projects

### Enterprise Projects

#### CI/CD Work
Maintain ownership of office's CI/CD pipeline, manage build boxes with SALT, Jenkins, and VMWare. 
I work on upgrading libraries/dependencies, as well as ensuring projects have code coverage through Sonar.

#### Permissions Software
I've worked on various projects for the Security Policy Manager team at iManage, building software to ensure that solicitors only have access to files that they are supposed to.
This often involves working with very large datasets, and making sure that programs are efficient.

#### Predictive Modelling
Created Loss Models of Car/Property Claims to minimise losses to company.

### Personal Projects

#### Chat analyser
I pulled all my conversation data from Facebook and Whatsapp, and built a database in MongoDB where I could search for and view all my messages. I then built a back end through Python, exposing an Rest API to a front end, which I then built in React. This was started as a casual project to make a 'On this day' feature for my past messages, but ended up with a solid project.

#### Various Game Projects
I enjoy spending my free time developing games in Unity/C#. I've not released anything as of yet, but it's fun none the less. Currently in the early stages of a Pong inspired rougelite. 

#### Github Analyser
As part of the PhD I began, I worked on making an analyser for Github using python and MongoDB. This utilised a public resource GHTorrent to pull public information about github projects, and build network graphs between projects based on contributions. This would have been used to analyse the quality of various FOSS projects, had I remained at the PhD.
